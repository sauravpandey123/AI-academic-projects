# Academic Projects

This repository contains selected academic projects from my graduate coursework and research at UNC Chapel Hill. These projects highlight my work in applied machine learning, security, and large-scale inference systems.

## 🔍 Mystic AI: A Mystery Game with Large Language Models (LLMs)
**PDF:** [`mystic-ai/mystic_ai_report.pdf`](mystic-ai/mystic_ai_report.pdf)

An interactive, LLM-driven mystery game where players interrogate suspects and deduce a hidden culprit using multi-turn reasoning.  
Built with Python and FastAPI, the system uses structured prompt engineering to produce consistent clues and character responses.  
Automated evaluations showed that multi-turn questioning improved culprit-identification accuracy by **up to 50 percentage points** over zero-shot prompting.

## 🛡️ Securing AI-Driven Medical Diagnostics
**PDF:** [`securing-ai-medical-diagnostics/ai_diagnostics_report.pdf`](securing-ai-medical-diagnostics/ai_diagnostics_report.pdf)

An analysis of vulnerabilities in deep learning pipelines for medical X-ray diagnostics.  
Demonstrated severe performance degradation (up to **60% accuracy drop**) under adversarial attacks on EfficientNet-B0 and VGG16.  
Built a robust adversarial example detection system in Keras achieving **95% detection accuracy** and used Grad-CAM to improve interpretability and clinical safety.
